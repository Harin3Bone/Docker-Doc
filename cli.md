# CLI

What is Docker CLI

**Docker Command Line Interface (CLI)** is a set of command line program that are designed to execute on Unix style command line environment. For **Linux** user **CLI** is only way to use **Docker** not like **Windows** and **MacOS**. They have **Docker Desktop** and fortunately for them they can use **CLI** too. By the way I recommended everyone use **Docker** by **CLI**. **** Because it useful more than **Docker Desktop**.
